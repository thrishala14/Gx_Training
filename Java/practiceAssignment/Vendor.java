/**
 * 8. 	A vendor offers software services to a client. Each resource is billed at some dollar rate per hour. 
 * 		The total cost of the project for the client is therefore, the total number of hours contributed by 
 * 		all the vendor resources * the dollar rate / hour. There are however some variants. 
 * 	a. The vendor might have purchased hardware/infrastructure or software licenses needed for the project. 
 * 	b. The vendor might have utilized external consultants for the project. 
 * 	c. The client looks at the vendor as a one stop solution and hence external resources employed by the
 * 		 vendor need to be paid by the vendor. 
 * 	d. It might however be possible that the vendorâ€™s hardware and software purchases are borne by the client. 
 * 		In this case, the client pays the vendor 30% of the hardware/infrastructure costs. In case of software
 * 		licenses, the client pays the vendor 50% of the cost, if they are commonly available and used, 
 * 		or 100% if the software is infrequently used or is proprietary client technology. 
 * 	e. The external consultants employed by the vendor will come at a dollar rate per hour. 
 * 	f. Accept the suitable inputs and display the profits / loss realized by the vendor.
